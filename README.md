# LazyATC
Tired of sending messages to people with outdated simbrief? Now you can do it 57% faster!

This tool allows you to quickly get message templates to let people know that, in fact, you can NOT file through RIVET outbound YSSY ðŸ’€
Operation is quite simple, you enter the correct route, then just hit enter, then copy. Now you have the whole thing ready to paste into the chat and watch the pilot realise they are a child of simbrief.
Auto routing coming soon....
